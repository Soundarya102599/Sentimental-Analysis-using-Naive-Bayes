# Sentimental-Analysis-using-BERT
Sentiment analysis using BERT for classification with PyTorch and the transformers library,
Loaded sentiment analysis dataset (stored in a CSV file) and preprocesses it.Tokenized the text data using the BERT tokenizer.Splitted the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.Defined PyTorch datasets and data loaders for training, validation, and test sets.Loaded a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification and defined an optimizer and a learning rate scheduler for training the model.Trained the model for a specified number of epochs and evaluated the trained model on the validation set and calculates the validation accuracy.Tested the trained model on the test set and calculates the test accuracy.Defined a function predict_sentiment that takes an input text, tokenizes it using the BERT tokenizer, feeds it into the model, and returns the predicted sentiment label.Loaded the pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer, as well as the trained model weights saved as a .pth file.The predict_sentiment function tokenize the input text, pass it through the model, obtain the logits (raw output scores) for each sentiment class, and extract the predicted sentiment label by taking the argmax of the logits.Defined a mapping from label indices to sentiment labels ({0: "negative", 1: "neutral", 2: "positive"}) and used it to convert the predicted label to the corresponding sentiment label.Demonstrated the usage of the predict_sentiment function with an example input text and print the predicted sentiment label.
