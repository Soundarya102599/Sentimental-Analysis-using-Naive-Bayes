# Sentimental-Analysis-using-Naive-Bayes
Prepared a dataset of sample tweets from the NLTK package for NLP with different data cleaning methods. Once the dataset is ready for processing,trained a model on pre-classified tweets  and used the model to classify the sample tweets into negative and positives sentiments.The process is as follows:1)Installed NLTK and Downloaded th8)e Data.2)Tokenized the Data.3)Normalized the Data.4)Removed Noise from the Data.5)Determined Word Density.6)Prepared Data for the Model.7)Converted Tokens to a Dictionary.8)Built and Tested the Model(Naive Bayes)
